Experiments were located in the same site each year at the Horticultural Experiment Station near Simcoe, Ontario, Canada. The topography of the area is gently rolling and soil types vary (Hohner and Presant 1989). The experimental site was oriented on a northâ€“south axis. Blocks were arranged to accommodate soil and topographic conditions as follows: block one (b1) on a south facing slope with a Tuscola loam (28% sand, 60% silt, 12% clay); block two (b2) on a slight north facing slope with Bookton sand (70% sand, 24% silt, 6% clay); and block three (b3) with a slight rise in the centre on a Fox sand (64% sand, 29% silt, 7% clay).

Cover crop treatments were as follows: Tetra Petkus rye, Frederick winter wheat, Tove perennial ryegrass, and a 2-yr rye-tomato rotation.

Nitrogen was applied at 45 kg ha followed by 45 kg ha as a sidedress when tomato plants were established.
